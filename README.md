### Human Resources Analytics:  Predictive Optimization Models for Managing Employee Attrition

##### Motivation:
One of the most critical issues facing organizations today is How To Retain The Employees They Want To Keep. Employee departures cost a company time, money, and other resources. Research suggests that direct replacement costs can reach as high as 50%-60% of an employeeâ€™s annual salary (SHRM, 2010). Given the increasing difficulty of keeping valued employees on board, it is well worth the effort to study how to effectively manage employee retention using analytics. 

##### Key question: 
What are the connections between individual attrition decisions and employment status indicators?

##### Implications:
- Predict attrition in the organization
- Insights on why employees leave and why they stay
- Develop an effective retention management plan to minimize employee attrition rate

##### Dataset created by IBM data scientists, including 1470 employees of 31 meaningful variables within 35 indicators:
- Training: 734 rows    
- Test: 736 rows
